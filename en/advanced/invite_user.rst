Use Case
----------
Consider following use case: As an Organization that is running a program on VUSION, you would like to be able to grant access to certain members of your institution access to your program. Using the Invite user functionality will allow you to do just that.

Please note:
::
	"NOTE that the invite user functionality is User specific. Only users with rights to perform this action will be able to do so."

How To Invite a User
------------------------

When you have successfully logged in, look at the top right of the black bar. You will see a link for Users as seen below:

   :width: 850px


Click the Users link and you will be taken to the users index page, as below:

.. image:: _static/img/invite_user_users_index.png
   :width: 850px

In this case, the above user has not yet invited anyone, so his users index is blank.

To invite a user, click on the Invite User button on the left of the screen. You will be taken to the page below:

For more details on users, please see :doc:`Understanding User Levels </advanced/understanding-user-levels>`
* *Program* is a multi-select drop down list from which you can choose the program(s) that the invited user will be able to access. Click inside the textbox to access the list.
