General

The limit feature is a tool to make sure the limit (amount of messages and time limit) can not be exceeded.
User levels of manager and higher can configure it. Others can see it but not edit it.


Scenario's
______________
- Someone opts in and is supposed to get 2 messages back. You only have one credit left. The first message will be sent, the second wont.
History will show a no-credit status. If you adjust the limit to 50 messages more, the message will not be send afterwards. You will need to reschedule the message.

- Time limit has been reached but there are still credits left; no more messages will be sent. The entire program is **shut down**
