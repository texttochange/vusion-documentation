Requests
#########################

General
=================

A request will enable participants to interact with Vusion. The most important part of a request is the keyword.
This will allow the system to know about what the participant is texting and respond with an appropiate answer/action.
The green sign means that the keyword is not in use yet, if a red cross appears it is in use by another programm. You will need to choose another keyword.

A response is what the person who texted the keyword to the shortcode will receive immediately after texting.
Responses should not exceed the 160 character limit of a text message.

When you have designed the response you can add an action to the request. This is something that will happen
when someone texts the keyword to the shortcode.

It is important to note that **all** participants will need to be opted in in order to be able to participate in the program.

Once all this is done, safe your request.
